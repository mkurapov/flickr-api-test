node-stocksnap.io
====================

A make-shift api interpreter for stocksnap.io

## Installation
````
  npm install stocksnap.io --save
````

## Usage
#### Variables:
````
query:(string) Search term, can be null (will default to no search).  
options:(object) can contain:  
  * sort:(string) Choose which sorting page you're using, can be 'relevance' (when using a search query), 'date', 'trending', 'views', 'downloads' and 'favorites'.  
  * pages:(int) Amount of pages you want to rip.  
  * shuffle:(bool) If you want to shuffle the final array for a more random array of photos.  
  * highres:(bool) If you want the image links referencing to the downloadable high res images instead of the thumbnails.

fn:(function) Callback that gives an array with photos as a variable.  
````

#### Code

```javascript
//Require the module
var stocksnap = require('stocksnap.io');

//options object
var options = {
  sort: 'views'
};

//Getting pictures of doors
stocksnap('doors', options, function (snaps) {
  console.log('Pictures of doors', snaps);
});
//Look at test.js for more examples
```
## Tests
````
  npm test
````

## Sidenote
When using the "highres" option in the api, you'll notice that you can't download the images going to the links or directly reference them in `<img>` tags.  
This is because of the (genius) architecture of StockSnap.io. In order to download the higher res photo's you need to do a `POST` request to the links, instead of a `GET`.
